    <h2>About the Token</h2>
    <p>
      SAMESAME is a new MEME bases, ERC-20 token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
      It has a fixed supply and does not claim any known utility, long-range roadmap, or intrinsic investment purpose other than to exist as a way to participate in crypto.
      The project is provided as-is as a simple token experiment by one human developer with an interest in the crypto markets and their long-term trajectory.

      <p>This is NOT financial advice. Investing in any Memecoin is an inherent risk and could result in possible financial losses. Be smart, be real, be samesame.</p>
